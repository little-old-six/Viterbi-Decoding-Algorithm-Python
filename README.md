# Viterbi Decoding in Python

**Status:** Under update, version 1.0

This is a coding exercise I completed for a course at Sun Yat-Sen University, "Information Theory and Coding."

This work attempts to present the decoding of the Convolutional Code in different ways, 
and includes a Python implementation of encoding and decoding using Viterbi method, which is a kind of 
hard in and out algorithm.

Code now works on Python 3.6 and even higher versions.

**Addition:** The construct of codes, in this project, is the (7,5) conv.code, 
which might be also referred as the (2,1,2) conv. code. By the way, the more details about this code is
in the program file, as well.
